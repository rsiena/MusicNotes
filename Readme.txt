Music Notes is a program that reads the notes.txt file 
the notes.txt file has 2 fields on each line seperated by a comma
field 1 is the line of text to display 
field 2 is help text that is displayed if you type h
if you start the musicnotes.py with options
-? for help 
-a displays accidentals
-h does not give you the help option
-s has been disabled it was suppose to change the sharp and flat character to the word but it seems python does not like unicode characters very much.

I wanted to be able to accept a single character as input but it appears that function was removed in python with the current versions.  

If you know how to do that please let me know.

you are free to distribute and use please make a reference to where you got the program from.
